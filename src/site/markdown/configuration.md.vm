$symbol_pound$symbol_pound Configuration

The CQ Component Plugin requires 2 Maven configurations.  First is the plugin configuration itself.
Second is the addition of a Maven dependency containing the annotations used to identify Java Classes as Components
and Fields and Methods as authorable elements as well as the abstract classes and interfaces necessary extends the plugin.
